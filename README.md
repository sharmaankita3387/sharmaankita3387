## What I Do
### **Mechanistic Interpretability & LLM Systems**
- Reverse-engineering LLM internals using tools like hooks, activation patching, and ablations  
- Analyzed **GPT-2 → GPT-3 architectural jumps** (parallel attention, RMSNorm, rotary embeddings, scaling)  
- Designed the blueprint for a **Python-based interpretability library**
- Built reproducible notebooks for visualizing attention patterns and head behaviors

### **Software Engineering & EdTech Leadership**
- Tech Lead at **McMaster Start Coding** building a grade-school edutainment app  
- Coordinated a cross-functional team (5 engineers + 3 designers)  
- Mentoring juniors in Elm & functional programming

### **Full-Stack Developer: Chordly**
- Built a responsive guitar-learning web app  
- Implemented real-time chord detection & visualization  
- Improved user engagement by **30%**
