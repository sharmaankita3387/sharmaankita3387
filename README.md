### Hi, I’m Ankita: Aspiring ML Researcher & Software Engineer exploring the space where, *mechanistic interpretability, scalable systems, and agentic ML intersect.*

## What I Did: 
## **Mechanistic Interpretability & LLM Systems**
GitHub Notebook: [github.com/DSC-McMaster-U/glassbox-llms/blob/main/notebooks/transformerlens_breakdown](https://github.com/DSC-McMaster-U/glassbox-llms/blob/main/notebooks/transformerlens_breakdown.ipynb) 
- Reverse-engineering LLM internals using tools like hooks, activation patching, and ablations
- Built reproducible notebooks for visualizing attention patterns and head behaviors

GitHub Notebook: [github.com/DSC-McMaster-U/glassbox-llms/blob/main/notebooks/interpretability_for_modernLLMs](https://github.com/DSC-McMaster-U/glassbox-llms/blob/main/notebooks/interpretability_for_modernLLMs.ipynb) 
- Analyzed **GPT-2 → GPT-3 architectural jumps** (parallel attention, RMSNorm, rotary embeddings, scaling)  
- Designed the blueprint for a **Python-based interpretability library**

## **Software Engineering & EdTech Leadership**
- Tech Lead at **McMaster Start Coding** building a grade-school edutainment app  
- Coordinated a cross-functional team (5 engineers + 3 designers)  
- Mentoring juniors in Elm & functional programming

## Featured Project: Spam Email Classifier (From Scratch in C)
**Repository**: [SpamEmailClassifier](https://github.com/sharmaankita3387/SpamEmailClassifier) </br> </br>
**Description**: A lightweight, dependency-free spam email classifier implemented entirely in C, using a mathematically rigorous Naive Bayes model. </br>

**Goal**: `Most ML projects hide the fundamentals behind libraries. I wanted to understand ML at the lowest level: probability, memory, performance, and correctness by implementing everything from scratch.`

## **What I Built**
1. Core ML Implementation
- Implemented Naive Bayes text classification from first principles
- Applied Laplace smoothing to prevent zero-probability failures
- Used log-probabilities to avoid numerical underflow
- Designed probabilistic outputs with configurable classification thresholds

2. Systems & Software Engineering
- Pure C implementation with zero dependencies, portable across platforms
- Memory-efficient design supporting 50,000+ word vocabularies
- Thread-safe architecture, suitable for server-side integration
- Clean modular structure (classifier_core, probability_calc, naive_bayes)

3. Testing & Reliability
- Comprehensive test suite with 95%+ code coverage (gcov)
- Deterministic behavior and reproducible results
- Defensive memory management and clean resource teardown </br>

## How It Works (Briefly): </br>
**Naive Bayes classification**: 𝑃 (spam ∣ email) ∝ 𝑃(spam) × ∏𝑃 (word ∣ spam) </br>
**With Laplace smoothing**: 𝑃(word ∣ spam) = (count(word) + 𝛼) / (total words + 𝛼 ⋅ ∣vocab∣) </br>

Skills Demonstrated
- Machine Learning Fundamentals: Probabilistic models, Bayesian reasoning
- Low-Level Systems Programming: C, memory management, performance
- Software Engineering: Testing, modular design, cross-platform builds
- ML Without Frameworks: No PyTorch, no scikit-learn — just math + code
